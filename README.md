# Yello- Track Your Chicks

**Use the App [here](https://chic-tracker.herokuapp.com/)**

**App Developer**:

**App Overview**

You won't have to worry about being too early for the bus stop with Yello. Track your kid's bus routes as they ride through town. 

**Resources**
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/): An open source API which allows developers access to maps, direction, geolocation, and other GPS-related functionality! I queried this API to show updated bus locations. 
* [React](https://expressjs.com/): a Javascript framework with built-in methods to perform CRUD functionality in your app. I used React to build out frontend logic, sch as displaying data with which users can interact and design to make the best user experience.
* [Ruby](http://handlebarsjs.com/): allows you to build dynamic HTML and semantic templates. I built my server in Ruby in order to provide data for my app.
* [Rails](https://nodejs.org/en/): a Javascript runtime that allows you to develop apps. I wrote in Rails to interact with Active Record and better manipulate the data.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/): a SQL database.
* [Active Record](https://www.mongodb.com/): a framework with built-in methods to create, read, update, and delete data in your SQL database! Active Record interfaced between Rails and PostgreSQL, making data transfer much easier.
* [CSS](https://expressjs.com/): the coding language that gives your site style. 
*[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/): styled-components is a JS library which allows developers to easily style their React components. I style in styled-components because it keeps my CSS code ore organized and readible.



**The Planning Stages**

* [Trello User Stories](https://trello.com/b/fONwUMCd/yello)
* [ERD](https://www.figma.com/file/A1O4hu086VfuxXPHC2JqJq/Yello-ERD)
* [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/lBiyr67mLiAeQiK7lwUkAv/Yello-Wireframes)

During this project, I allowed myself to dedicate time to the planning process. I wanted to anticipate all issues that I may face and to be prepared to deliver MVP first. Before diving into planning, I researched the Google Maps API. alloting myself the time to be familiar with the API, what problems that I may face and how I can solve those problems. 

Here are some questions that I asked myself:
How do I get the bus driver’s current location constantly?
How do I update that location in real time on the user’s end? 
How do I get their location identifying icon on the map in the frontend?
How do I get that map in the frontend?
What sort of component holds that map?
What sort of users do I have? How are they connected?
What is the MVP for database?
What is the MVP for components?
What is the MVP for the API?
How do I get the map into my React frontend? How to integrate the Google Maps API into React.js

Make an API call!!!
What models do I need? Do I need a map model? It has the properties of an id, city, lat, lng.
How do I keep safety and security?
How do I solve the problem of having client-to-server-to-client interactions without a web socket?
How do I have multiple user logins? (Polymorphic Data Model)

Some of which were solved by my code. Some solved in my mind. And some left to time.

**Unsolved Problems**

* Authentication and Authorization
* Logging information to a particular user as opposed to anyone being able to log that information

**What I learned**

I learned so much from developing my other apps. I learned that panic is the last answer and only leads to unfinished code. I also learned that timeboxing and planning can facilitate better code. I sometimes dive into code, feeling like I can tackle the problems as they arise; however, anticipating issues helped me to calmly develop this capp.

**Version 2**

Version 2 will allows parents and drivers to login and update their information in real-time without the interface of an admin.

**Improvements from Project Three**
* Attention to planning stages
* Better use of programmatic thinking
* Cleaner, better organized code and state
* More diverse problem-solving
* Focused on one task at a time
* Used user stories to drive my development


**Our Proudest Moment**

My proudest moment was preparing before programming. It made the process easier.

**My Weakest Moment**

Last night, I felt that my app looked eerily like my others, but I overcame this moment by planning out some style and focusing on delivering something of which I can be proud.
